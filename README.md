# FAHWebControl

Folding@Home Webcontrol is a web-based version of the FAHControl client, provided with [Folding@Home software](http://folding.stanford.edu/home/). It uses a PHP backend to communicate with the FAHClient running on various folding machines, and a javascript frontend to display various statistics about the machines. As this project is currently a work in progress, I am not able to provide help, nor will I be able to provide sufficient install instructions. If you do wish to help, feel free to submit an issue and/or a pull request.

*Included Files:*

* wrapper.lua: A wrapper that connects to FAHClient via tcp, grabs the info, and returns it in json format.
